          <h3>Digital Art</h3>
          <p>
            Since 2020, I have been a passionate digital artist. My digital art
            journey has allowed me to pay attention to small but critical
            details and serves as one of the best examples of growth in my life.
            I love to draw and participate in art contests in my free time. I
            also enjoy incorporating my artistic skills into projects,
            schoolwork, helping friends, and even in the development of this
            website.

          <p>
            I've been musically active and playing the piano since I was 8 years
            old, studying with a piano teacher. I have been learning piano for
            quite a long time and have really enjoyed learning new pieces. As
            school has become busier, I made the difficult decision to
            discontinue lessons, but I will forever stay musical at heart.

            (Spring 2023) at a New England Piano Teacher's Association (NEPTA)
            recital. This is a juried recital, meaning piano teachers select
            only a few students to perform.

          <h3>Exchange Student</h3>
          <p>
            A fun fact: I was an exchange student! Our high school exchange
            program is one of the oldest student-teacher exchange programs
            between the United States and China. After a four-year hiatus, the
            program was resumed, and my exchange group was the first
            post-pandemic group to restart it.
          </p>
          <p>
            From January to May 2025, five other students and I had a fully
            immersive experience in a completely new culture, language, and way
            of life. It was a life-changing time for me.

            Inspired by my dad and friends, I picked up badminton in my freshman
            year of high school. During that year, I wasn't very serious about
            playing, but it was the first time I ever held a badminton racket.

            Now, I wish someone had introduced me to this sport sooner! By my
            sophomore year, I was playing actively and participating in
            competitions with my team. My favorite part is spending time with
            friends while staying in shape.

            Ballet is another major part of my life. I've been dancing for
            almost 10 years. It has taught me teamwork, discipline, and how to
            stay in shape. I practiced ballet and pointe work for about three
            years before needing to take a step back due to Achilles tendon
            discomfort.

            Since I was young, I have been an avid Scratch user. I loved
            creating projects and growing within a supportive community. Diving
            into Scratch sparked my interest in combining digital art with
            programming. Today, I carry that same passion by teaching younger
            kids the fun of coding and helping them bring their creations to
            life. You can read more about my projects in the{" "}

          <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
          <p>
            Building on my digital art journey, graphic design was the next step
            to take everything to the next level. I have always loved the idea
            of putting my art on a T-shirt or notepadâ€”something practical that I
            could use.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I finally got into the Graphics Communications course at my
            high school, I was overjoyed! Although it was only a semester-long
            course, I consistently went above and beyond in my projects, often
            working on them before and after school. This class was definitely
            one of the highlights of my sophomore year, and I look forward to
            continuing to create in the graphics workshop.
